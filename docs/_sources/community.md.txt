# Community

Our community up until recently has resided soley on Meetup.com. With the recent
change in leadership the decision has been made to expand our online footprint.

We will continue to use Meetup.com for organizing events and to keep in contact
with the community at large. However our focus will be growing our Slack
workspace to provide a richer experience for those wanting more interaction with
others.

## Meetup.com

We have an active Meetup group where event announcements are made.

Come join the group at: [https://www.meetup.com/tampa-bay-python/](https://www.meetup.com/tampa-bay-python/)

## Slack

Slack serves as our messaging platform to hold discussions about in-person and
online events, news in the Python ecosystem, general Python help, and much more.

Popular channels include:
- #general
- #introduction
- #hiring-looking
- #python-help
- #events
