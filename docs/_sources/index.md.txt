# Tampa Bay Python

> Tampa Bay Python is a community of professions, enthusiasts, students, and
> companies using or learning Python in the Tampa Bay area.

We hold at least one event per month in-person and perform remote office hours
twice a month. Anyone is welcome to our meetups regardless of your skill set or
skill level.

Our [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct.md) clarifies our organization's
missions, values, and principals, linking them with standards of professional
conduct.

We use [Slack](/community.md) to hold online discussions about organizing
events, getting technical help, looking or posting about jobs, or just about
anything else you'd like to talk about.
