# Request for comment about Meetup group!

I'm Matthew, a Tampa native and long-time user of Python.

I've recently inherited the Meetup group and am interested in growing the
community and seeing everyone have a good time connecting on common
interests. :)

I understand your time is valuable so I'll be brief: I'd like to ask if you
could fill out this quick 2 minute survey about the direction you'd like to see
the group go. Thank you in advance for your opinions!

Here's the survey link: [https://tampabaypython.typeform.com/community](https://tampabaypython.typeform.com/community)

I have went ahead and setup a Slack workspace for Tampa Bay Python as well, feel
free to join and meet the rest of the community!

Here's the Slack invite link: [https://join.slack.com/t/tampabaypython/shared_invite/zt-xwb0hasz-ueoy79~rD7DWbWkaI1yTiw](https://join.slack.com/t/tampabaypython/shared_invite/zt-xwb0hasz-ueoy79~rD7DWbWkaI1yTiw)

In the coming weeks I'll have [https://tampabaypython.org/](https://tampabaypython.org/) hosted and will be
planning the first presentation.
